# NPMSEARCHER
its a tool that.. you can search github and npm with!
you run it. choose ur query. choose query size and a site.
## ALSO 
### you need to make a lib/config.json file
i .gitignored it bc it uses this one package i found an it requires like actual user stuff.
so you need to be all like:
```
{
    "name": "ur name",
    "pass": "ur github pass"
}
```
i promise its not gonna steal ur stuff
BAHAHAH I FORGOT TO SAY THE PACKAGE IS LIKE 7 YEARS OLD LMAOOOO
